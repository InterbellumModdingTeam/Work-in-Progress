## File for the infantry equipment containing its Archtype and its upgrades. ##
## To add more use the equipment tag and increase the value by 1.            ##
## For instance 'infantry_equipment_1' becomes 'infantry_equipment_2'        ##
## All stats been set to '0' to allow complete freedom in creation.          ##
