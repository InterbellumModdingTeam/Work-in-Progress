## File for the Tank equipment containing its Archtype and its upgrades.         ##
## To add more use the equipment tag and increase the value by 1.                ##
## For instance 'heavy_tank_equipment_1' becomes 'heavy_tank_equipment_2'        ##
## Unlike the Infantry weapons we also need to include the TD, SPG and MAA here. ##
## All stats and values been set to '0' to allow complete freedom in creation.   ##
