## This file is where define how strong the unit really is.   ##
## Its where we also define what type of equipment we use.    ##
## This in conjuntion with the equipment file.                ##
## Combined the equipment + this file will make the unit.     ##
## Assign its stats and atributes.                            ##
## Equipent is called on by its ARCHTYPE, not the version.    ##
## Decimal values mean 1 = 100%, 0 = 0% to get 50% use 0.5    ##
## exception to this is the supply_consumption, the value     ##
## will be how much supply used by this unit. 0.6 means that  ##
## 1 brigade of this type will use 0.6. so if 3 brigades are  ##
## used in 1 template you would get 3 x 0.6 = 1.8 total       ##
## supply use by that template.                               ##
##                                                            ##
## If a unit has a speed set this gets ADDED to the equipment ##
## Speed is a full + decimal value, meaning that if we add    ##
## 4.5 as a value, the speed of the equipment increase by     ##
## 4.5 km/h 0.7 would increase it by 0.7 km/h and so on.      ##
##                                                            ##
